# GroupProject-UnitySummary
The group project was a year-long course in which we developed a comprehensive game using the Unity engine. 
The repo contains information about our _Complete Game Recording_, _Technical Report of the Game_, _Highlight Technical Summary Presentation (PPT)_, _Online & Offline Promotion Report_. 
The content included in the repo is completely consistent with the material we submitted for our course. **For a brief and quick understanding of the project, the Promotion Report and the Technical Summary Presentation (PPT) are recommended for reading.**
