# GroupProject-UnitySummary
The group project was a year-long course in which we developed a comprehensive game using the Unity engine. 
The repo contains information about our Complete Game Recording, Technical Report of the Game, Highlight Summary Presentation (PPT), Online and Offline Promotion Report. 
The content included in the repo is completely consistent with the material we submitted for our course.
